<p>This is the official introduction on official <a href="https://dart.dev">site</a> for dart. Dart is a language introduced by Google to specifically address the problem of fast app development on any platform. This specififc language together with set of tools(flutter) aims to have a single code base for different platforms, be it android, ios or web.</p>

<p>This effort is commendable as it would definitly reduce the development time for development groups maintaining separate codebases for web app and native apps.</p>

<p>To someone who already has some experience in C, javascript, python, java etc. Dart seems to be a derivative of C and java and javascript incorporating good elements of all. It is staticly typed language but it also provides developers with dynamic behaviour in case needed.</p>

    <span class="n">print</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">'something);
}
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Static language: The datatype of the variable is defined at the time of variable declaration, unlike python. Also, the datatype of a variable cannot be changed once declared, unlike python. This has a inherent advantage of having less bugs.</p>
<div class="language-dart highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">){</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">age</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">12</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="n">print</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">age</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="n">age</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">'12'</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="c1">//this produces error as age has to be integer</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Dynamic language: The datatype of variable can be changed at any point of time. This behaviour can be found in python and javascript. This may accelerate the developement time in short run by a small margin but the code is more prone to bugs.</p>

<div class="language-dart highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">){</span>
    <span class="kd">dynamic</span> <span class="n">age</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">12</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="n">print</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">age</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="n">age</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">'12'</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="n">print</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">age</span><span class="o">);</span> <span class="c1">//this is explicitly forcing dynamic behaviour on age varibale</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Data types are quite similar to other programming language. Such as int, float, bool, String, List</p>
