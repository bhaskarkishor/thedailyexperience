I"°<p>This is Bhaskar Kishor, an engineering student pursuing Mechanical Engineering from IIT Bhubaneswar.</p>

<p>This blog is a product of my interest in tech domains, namely Web Development and Machine Learning. I started web development as a hobby during schools and I have been moving in so far. Mostly, I write about my personal experience during this learning endeavour. And its a reference for me to myself in the future.</p>
