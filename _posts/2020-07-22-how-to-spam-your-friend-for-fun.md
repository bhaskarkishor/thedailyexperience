Today, I am writing this just out of fun. It's about How I spammed my friends WhatsApp inbox from a third party unknown Number. But discovering that how easy it is to make a fake account on whatsApp and scam people is alarming and to some degree frightening. Actually after doing this, I am a bit more skeptical about about the online security thing. Maybe sky is the limit of whats actually possible to do in an online world.

#### What do I need to spam my friend?
So First of all lets just have a quick look on how anyone with a internet connection, android/ios and a pc(to run script for spam) can get a whatsapp account. Mind You I just mentioned **android device** and **an internet connection**, a phone number issued at your name is not compulsory.

##### But... WhatsApp asked for your otp while registration to confirm my identity, Right? 
That's the whole security step. But the thing is you can get a VoIP phone number for free without any document proof. There are many ways, to bypass the whatsApp otp method. 

Just a quick Google Search, 'online sms receive' will take you to the sites where you will get an open number where you can receive otp. So grab such a site and a phone number from there. When asked for otp from WhatsApp just put this number and wait for the otp to appear on the site inbox.

So you have a WhatsApp account with an unknown(God knows Whose) number. You can use it to have the fun. Just message your friend and let him play detective. 

You can check the history of number on Truecaller if its marked spam or anything, just so that your friend doesn't block you in first try.

#### But I wanted to spam him, doing it manually was no fun!
For this step, one could simply use WhatsApp web and a selenium script to automatically send some messages to a friend. If you are already good with some scripting language or you want to learn go ahead and write a script to do what you want.
But I was lazy and I lost to myself. So in search of script I just hit github to look for scripts to automate whatsapp, and I was surprised, I was late to the party.

Already so many people have written scripts for this thing in so many flavours. After going through a few of them, I settled for a python selenium script. And just ran it and Boom. 


My friend was confused who is messaging him from Canada, when He has never been there nor he knows anyone there.

#### Later when I revealed about How It was me...
Everone is like, How could this be so easy...

Many of us believe that otp is the secure lock on anything. An otp means, we have the confirmation that user exists in real world and it can be traced back to him to some extent. But these online free services that are operating beyond borders in grey zone are actually eye opener. These cannot be traced back to user except for the ip and mac address log(hopefully) they were maintaining.
