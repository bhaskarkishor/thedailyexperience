This lesson started with discussion of all the coll things people were doing that time and posting it on fastai forums. Seriously, it felt like propaganda for the platform too. But again it was intimidating as people were doing all sort of cool things out there. He is giving example of people who are actually pushing the boudaries. The guy who started with nothing but submitted a pull request next day and blah blah.....

In this class, he is again going with image processing. He discusses about fast ai library implementation. How its making life easier. And then while going through he discusses about learning rate.
```fit_one_cycle()```


Then he goes on explaining linear regression with gradient descent and all the maths stuff and it gets boring.
